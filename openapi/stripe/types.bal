# A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
# For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
# Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
# 
# Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
# Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
# The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
# you through the setup process.
# 
# Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
# For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
# [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
# in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
# If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
# it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
# We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
# PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
#

# [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
# client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
# and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
# 
# If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
# the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
# your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
# that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
# client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
# Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.

# Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in

# object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
# event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
# `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
# events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
# customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
# `charge.succeeded` event.
# 
# Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
# resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
# example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
# `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
# 
# As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
# [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
# from the API. We also have a separate

# in your
# [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
# and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
# 
# When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
# events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
# additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

# Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
# generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
# 
# They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
# that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
# 
# If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
# Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
# that finalizing the invoice,
# [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
# not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
# until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
# webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
# connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
# creation to finalize the invoice.
# 
# If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
# [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
# Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
# emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
# 
# Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
# amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
# charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
# per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
# invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
# customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

# You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.
