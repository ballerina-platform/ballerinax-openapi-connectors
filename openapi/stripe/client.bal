    # + invoiceItems - List of invoice items to add or update in the upcoming invoice preview. 
    # + schedule - The identifier of the unstarted schedule whose upcoming invoice you'd like to retrieve. Cannot be used with subscription or subscription fields.

If not provided, but a `subscription_items` is provided, you will preview creating a subscription with those items. If neither `subscription` nor `subscription_items` is provided, you will retrieve the next upcoming invoice from among the customer's subscriptions. 
    # + subscriptionBillingCycleAnchor - For new subscriptions, a future timestamp to anchor the subscription's [billing cycle](https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/billing-cycle). This is used to determine the date of the first full invoice, and, for plans with `month` or `year` intervals, the day of the month for subsequent invoices. For existing subscriptions, the value can only be set to `now` or `unchanged`. 
    # + subscriptionCancelAt - Timestamp indicating when the subscription should be scheduled to cancel. Will prorate if within the current period and prorations have been enabled using `proration_behavior`.

Valid values are `create_prorations`, `none`, or `always_invoice`. Passing `create_prorations` will cause proration invoice items to be created when applicable.

In order to always invoice immediately for prorations, pass `always_invoice`. Prorations can be disabled by passing `none`. 
    # + subscriptionProrationDate - If previewing an update to a subscription, and doing proration, `subscription_proration_date` forces the proration to be calculated as though the update was done at the specified time.

If set, `subscription`, and one of `subscription_items`, or `subscription_trial_end` are required. Also, `subscription_proration_behavior` cannot be set to 'none'.

    # + subscriptionTrialFromPlan - Indicates if a plan's `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `subscription_trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `subscription_trial_end` is not allowed.
