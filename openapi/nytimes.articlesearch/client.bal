    # + q - Search query term. Search is performed on the article body, headline and byline.

By default (unless you include an fl list in your request), the following fields are returned:    web_url   snippet   lead_paragraph   abstract   print_page   blog   source   multimedia   headline   keywords   pub_date   document_type   news_desk   byline   type_of_material   _id   word_count"
