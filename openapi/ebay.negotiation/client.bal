# This is a generated connector for [eBay Negotiation API v1.1.0](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/negotiation/overview.html) 
# OpenAPI Specification
# The Negotiations API provides capability to access sellers to proactively send discount offers to buyers who have shown an "interest" 
# in their listings.  By sending buyers discount offers on listings where they have shown an interest, sellers can increase 
# the velocity of their sales.  There are various ways for a buyer to show interest in a listing. For example, if a buyer
#  adds the listing to their Watch list,  or if they add the listing to their shopping cart and later abandon the cart, 
# they are deemed to have shown an interest in the listing.   In the offers that sellers send, they can discount their 
# listings by either a percentage off the listing price, or they can set a  new discounted price that is lower than the
#  original listing price.  For details about how seller offers work,  see "/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html" 
# title="Selling Integration Guide">Sending offers to buyers.

A listing ID is returned only when one or more buyers have shown an &quot;interest&quot; in the listing. If any buyers have shown interest in a listing, the seller can initiate a &quot;negotiation&quot; with them by calling sendOfferToInterestedBuyers, which sends all interested buyers a message that offers the listing at a discount.
