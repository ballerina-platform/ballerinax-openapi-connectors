For example, get a policy for the French locale of the Canadian marketplace by specifying fr-CA for the Content-Language header. Likewise, target the Dutch locale of the Belgium marketplace by setting Content-Language: nl-BE. For details on header values, see HTTP request headers.

    # This method creates or updates a sales tax table entry for a jurisdiction. Specify the tax table entry you want to configure using the two path parameters: countryCode and jurisdictionId. A tax table entry for a jurisdiction is comprised of two fields: one for the jurisdiction's sales-tax rate and another that's a boolean value indicating whether or not shipping and handling are taxed in the jurisdiction. You can set up tax tables for countries that support different tax jurisdictions. Currently, only Canada, India, and the US support separate tax jurisdictions. If you sell into any of these countries, you can set up tax tables for any of the country's jurisdictions. Retrieve valid jurisdiction IDs using getSalesTaxJurisdictions in the Metadata API. For details on using this call, see Establishing sales-tax tables. Important! Starting in January 2019, eBay will begin to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers. This feature is rolling out on specific dates to specific US states as defined on the following page: eBay sales tax collection. Once eBay starts to collect sales tax for a state, no action is required on the seller's part and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax. The sales-tax collection process will apply to all the sales in the states that support this feature, whether the seller is located in or outside of the United States. When a buyer purchases an item on eBay, and the ship-to address is one of the states where eBay collects the sales tax, eBay will calculate and add the applicable sales tax at checkout. The buyer will pay both the cost of the item along with the sales tax. eBay will collect and remit the tax.

    # This method is used by sellers onboarded for eBay managed payments, or sellers who are currently going through, or who are eligible for onboarding for eBay managed payments. With this method, a seller can discover if there are any action items in regards to providing more documentation and/or information about themselves, their company, or the bank account they are or will be using for seller payouts. These 'action items' are also know as 'Know Your Customer' (or KYC) checks. This method does not require any parameters other than the OAuth user token associated with the seller's account. If the managed payments seller does not currently have any pending 'KYC' action items, only a 204 No Content HTTP status code is returned, and no response payload. Note: This method is not applicable for sellers who are not eligible for eBay managed payments. For sellers who sell on one or more eBay marketplaces that currently support managed payments, they can check on their managed payments onboarding status by using the getPaymentsProgramOnboarding method.
