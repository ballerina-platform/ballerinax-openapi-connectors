    # + parent - Required. Project or location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's project. Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`. For global calls, use `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/global` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}`. Non-global location is required for requests using AutoML models or custom glossaries. Models and glossaries must be within the same region (have same location-id), otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. 
    # + payload - TranslateText request 
    # + return - Successful response
