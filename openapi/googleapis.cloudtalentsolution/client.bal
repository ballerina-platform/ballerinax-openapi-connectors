    # Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email alerts about potential job opportunities), it has different algorithmic adjustments that are designed to specifically target passive job seekers. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has permission to search against.
