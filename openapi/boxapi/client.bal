To get the Client ID for your application, log in to your Box developer console and click the **Edit Application** link for the application you're working with. In the OAuth 2.0 Parameters section of the configuration page, find the item labelled `client_id`. The text of that item is your application's Client ID.
    # + redirectUri - The URL to which Box redirects the browser after the user has granted or denied the application permission. This URL must match the redirect URL in the configuration of your application. It must be a valid HTTPS URL and it needs to be able to handle the redirection to complete the next step in the OAuth 2.0 flow.
    # + state - A custom string of your choice. Box will pass the same string to the redirect URL when authentication is complete. This parameter can be used to identify a user on redirect, as well as protect against hijacked sessions and other exploits.
    # + scope - A comma-separated list of application scopes you'd like to authenticate the user for. This defaults to all the scopes configured for the application in its configuration page.

    # + xRepHints - A header required to request specific `representations` of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query parameter to request a specific file representation.  The general format for these representations is `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many hints in the format `[fileType?query]`.  For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32` as well as `94x94` pixel dimensions provide the following hints.  `X-Rep-Hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=94x94]`  Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]` representation.  `X-Rep-Hints: [extracted_text]`

Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the effect that none of the standard fields are returned in the response unless explicitly specified, instead only fields for the mini representation are returned, additional to the fields requested.  Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.
    # + ifNoneMatch - Ensures an item is only returned if it has changed.  Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value into this header and the endpoint will fail with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not changed since.

Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required then use `shared_link=[link]&shared_link_password=[password]`.  This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on any files or folders nested within the item.
