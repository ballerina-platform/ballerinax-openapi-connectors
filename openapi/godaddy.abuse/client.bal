# <strong>GoDaddy Abuse API Terms of Use:</strong><p>GoDaddy’s Abuse API is provided to simplify and standardize the abuse 
# reporting experience. To help us streamline the review of abuse reports, you acknowledge and agree that your use of 
# GoDaddy’s Abuse API is subject to the following quality metrics and terms of use.</p><p>GoDaddy may, in its sole and 
# absolute discretion, change or modify these terms, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon 
# notice to you. Your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API after such changes or modifications shall constitute your acceptance of 
# these terms as last revised. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) 
# our Abuse API.</p><p>As an Abuse API user, you must only submit abuse reports via the API portal and cease all email 
# submissions, including but not limited, to phishing@godaddy.com, netabuse@godaddy.com, malware@godaddy.com, or spam@godaddy.com, 
# etc.  Any additional or duplicate submission outside of the API portal will be deprioritized for review. Submissions related 
# to trademark, copyright or content issues may still be sent to trademarkclaims@godaddy.com, coyprightclaims@godaddy.com,
#  and contentcomplaints@godaddy.com, respectively. Our [Front of Site](https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/AbuseReport) 
# also describes other scenarios not covered by the API.</p><p>When you submit abuse reports via GoDaddy’s Abuse API, 
# you must ensure that you accurately categorize the abuse type of each report to match our definitions in the API 
# documentations provided to you. Any submission that fails to match our definitions or is miscategorized will be marked 
# as a false positive. Examples include, but are not limited to, submissions of trademark complaints marked as phishing 
# or malware, or submissions of copyright complaints marked as phishing or malware, etc.</p><p>If, at any time, the false 
# positive rate of submissions exceeds 40% of your total submissions, as determined by GoDaddy, GoDaddy may in its sole 
# discretion deprioritize any subsequent reports submitted by you and/or your organization.</p><p>You acknowledge and 
# agree that submitting every URL for a single domain is not necessary and will not expedite the review process. If your 
# submissions exceed five (5) URLs for a single domain, your report will be marked as a duplicate submission taking into 
# account that the final outcome of such submissions would yield the same result as the original report. GoDaddy may in 
# its sole discretion deprioritize reports submitted by you and/or your organization in the event more than 20% of your 
# submissions are classified as duplicate submissions.</p><p>You further acknowledge and agree that our Customer Support 
# lines are not intended to address abuse reporting matters or your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API. Contacting Customer 
# Support will not expedite the review process and may result in abuse reports being deprioritized, to be determined in 
# our sole discretion.</p><p>Should you have any questions about GoDaddy’s Abuse API or any of the terms and conditions 
# set forth above, please contact abuseapisupport@godaddy.com.</p>
