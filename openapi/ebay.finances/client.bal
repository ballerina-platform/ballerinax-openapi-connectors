# payment methods, and shortly after a buyer's payment clears, eBay distributes payouts directly to the  seller's preferred bank account.

    # or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past. lastAttemptedPayoutDate: search for attempted 
    # payouts that failed within a specific range of dates. In order to use this filter, the payoutStatus filter must also be 
    # used and its value must be set to RETRYABLE_FAILED. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. The same syntax 
    # used for the payoutDate filter is also used for the lastAttemptedPayoutDate filter. This filter is only applicable (and will return results)
