    # Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

    # Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. When inventory is updated with CreateProduct and UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) will overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update time for the specified inventory fields will be overwritten to the time of the CreateProduct or UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product will be used. If no inventory fields are set in UpdateProductRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information will be preserved.

For example: `collection_product_id = "some_product_id"` * List Products with a partibular type. For example: `type = "PRIMARY"` `type = "VARIANT"` `type = "COLLECTION"` If the field is unrecognizable, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If the specified Product.Type.PRIMARY Product or Product.Type.COLLECTION Product does not exist, a NOT_FOUND error is returned. 
    # + pageSize - Maximum number of Products to return. If unspecified, defaults to 100. The maximum allowed value is 1000. Values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000. If this field is negative, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. 
    # + pageToken - A page token ListProductsResponse.next_page_token, received from a previous ProductService.ListProducts call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to ProductService.ListProducts must match the call that provided the page token. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. 
    # + readMask - The fields of Product to return in the responses. If not set or empty, the following fields are returned: * Product.name * Product.id * Product.title * Product.uri * Product.images * Product.price_info * Product.brands If "*" is provided, all fields are returned. Product.name is always returned no matter what mask is set. If an unsupported or unknown field is provided, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
