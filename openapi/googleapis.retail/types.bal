In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response will be determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which will generate a facet 'gender'. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how Google Retail Search orders "gender" and "rating" facets.

The eligible fields for filtering are: * `eventType`: Double quoted UserEvent.event_type string. * `eventTime`: in ISO 8601 "zulu" format. * `visitorId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a visitor. * `userId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a user. Examples: * Deleting all events in a time range: `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` * Deleting specific eventType in time range: `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = "detail-page-view"` * Deleting all events for a specific visitor: `visitorId = "visitor1024"` The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
